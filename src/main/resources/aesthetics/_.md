# Introduction
In the [MDA framework (PDF)](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf), aesthetics are
classifications of the types of experiences that a player of the game has. They are the result of
the [dynamics](/dynamics) of the game.

There is great overlap in aesthetics.

# Examples
A dynamic of gradual attrition leads to an aesthetic of mounting tension, which contributes to both
narrative and challenge.
