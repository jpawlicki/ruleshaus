# Introduction
A player experiences challenge when they are delighted by the difficulty of accomplishing their goals
in a game.

A stronger challenge aesthetic doesn't necessarily imply greater difficulty. A strong challenge
aesthetic usually requires the eventual success of the player, so insurmountable difficulty does not
necessarily contribute.
