# Introduction
A player elimination dynamic occurs whenever a player is effectively removed from the game while
other players continue to play it. Generally, this occurs when a player has no more legal actions
and there is no mechanic by which they will regain legal actions.

Player elimination is not necessarily bad, as it can hasten the end-game and generally simplifies
the complexity of the strategies of the remaining players. However, it generally contributes
negatively to a [fellowship aesthetic](/games/aesthetics/fellowship), because the eliminated player
is no longer enjoying the group activity.

Some games also have voluntary self-elimination. Mechanics allowing for this account for the
possibility that players may leave the game, and are usually intended to allow the remaining players
to not feel the game has been "ruined" by the departure of one of the players.
