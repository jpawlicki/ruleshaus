# Introduction
In the [MDA framework (PDF)](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf), mechanics are the
underlying rules of a game. Their interactions with each other and with the players' desires give
rise to [Dynamics](/games/dynamics), which in turn give rise to [Aesthetics](/games/aesthetics).
Mechanics can be summarized as "rules".

# Examples
A character or unit in a game may perish when it reaches zero hit points. Enemies may do damage to
characters when battled.
