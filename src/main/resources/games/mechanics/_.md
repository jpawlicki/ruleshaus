# Introduction
In the [MDA framework (PDF)](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf), mechanics are the
underlying rules of a game. Their interactions with each other and with the players' desires give
rise to [Dynamics](/games/dynamics), which in turn give rise to [Aesthetics](/games/aesthetics).
Mechanics can be summarized as "the rules of the game".

Mechanics both cover the kinds of actions a player can take in the game as well as the evolution of
the game's internal state.

Game rules come in three forms:
 * **prohibitive** rules can be written in a "the player *must not*" form. Many games have an
   implicit prohibitive rule that the player cannot take any actions not explicitly allowed by
	 further rules.
 * **permissive** rules can be written in a "the player *may*" form, and are exceptions to
   prohibitive rules.
 * **imperative** rules can be written in a "the player *must*" form.

# Examples
A character or unit in a game must perish when it reaches zero hit points. Enemies may do damage to
characters when battled.
