# Introduction
A bidding mechanic is a mechanic by which a player can offer a variable amount of assets in exchange
for a new asset.

Bidding mechanics can be useful since they allow the value of an asset to be set by the players, and
can create game dynamics around competition for resources.

# Common Bidding Mechanics
There are a few typical bidding mechanics.

## Open Auction
Bidders either take turns or bid in real-time, publicly announcing a bid value that is higher than
all previous bid values. The auction ends either at a time limit or once no additional bids are
being made.

## Simultaneous Closed Auction
Every bidder commits to a certain value they are willing to pay, and all bids are revealed
simultaneously. The person who bid the most pays either the amount they offered or slightly more
than the next-best offer.
