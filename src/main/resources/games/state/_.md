# Introduction
A game's state is all the game-session-specific data about a game - whose turn it is, what cards are
in the deck or in players' hands and which order they are in, and so on.

Information consistent across game sessions is not part of the game state. This usually includes the
rules of the game itself.

The amount of game state is a product of the game's [complexity](/games/complexity). Game state
typically does not include the players themselves, though for [field](/games/field) games it often
includes at least their position. For example, in [tag](/games/field/examples/tag) one could claim
that the game state includes the relative positions, velocity, etc of the players (in addition to
who is "it").

One way to think about game state is: if the game were to be paused and resumed later, what
things would the players have to write down in order to recreate the current game situation?

A player's visibility into the game state is called [information](/games/information).

Tracking and displaying the game state is often done with the aid of artifacts, for example a game
board in some [tabletop games](/games/tabletop) or a video display in
[computer games](/games/computer).
