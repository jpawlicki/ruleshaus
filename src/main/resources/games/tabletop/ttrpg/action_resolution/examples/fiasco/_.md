# Overview

The action in Fiasco is broken down into scenes, and each scene places one or more players in charge
of resolution of that scene. Resolution of actions or conflict is determined by consensus, with
priority given to the player(s) in charge of resolution.

# Common Cases
Whether a character accomplishes their intent is determined by the narrative flow as ruled by the
consensus of the players with resolution power.

There are no special rules for group efforts.

There are no special rules for opposed efforts.

There are no special rules for difficulty.

# Hooks
1. Whether the resolution of the overall scene is positive or negative for a character.

# Notes
The categorization of Fiasco as a roleplaying game is controversial. This is primarily because the
players operate at a different level of abstraction with different goals than the characters
themselves. However, at many tables, the primary activity of players is imagining what the
characters would do and acting that out, which meets this library's definition of a roleplaying
game. Fiasco therefore falls into an ambiguous area, being a board game with roleplaying elements.
It is most useful for our purposes to consider it in comparison to other roleplaying games. In the
end, this library follows Wikipedia's classification of the game as a roleplaying game.
