# Introduction
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple [stateless](/games/state) game in which both players simultaneously
select one of three actions (rock, paper, or scissors). If two different actions are selected, rock
beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock, and the associated player wins. Else,
the game repeats.

# Strategy
Rock-Paper-Scissors is interesting because it relies entirely on the 
[prediction dynamic](/games/dynamics/prediction). Therefore, a player who plays truly randomly has
exactly a 50% probability of victory.
