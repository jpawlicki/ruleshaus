# Introduction
Chess is a symmetrical [tabletop game](/games/tabletop) played on an eight-by-eight board with
pieces that maneuver in particular ways. It features
[completely open information](/games/information) and the movement mechanics are simple enough to
allow even amateur players to look ahead several moves in a "if I do X, they might do Y" form.

Chess is particularly interesting due to the transferrability of its main skill. The process of
evaluating the potential moves has been codified in the
[minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm, which is applicable widely to games and
general strategy. Most games involving open information and turn-based moves will cause the players
to engage in the same problem-solving strategies that are used in Chess.
