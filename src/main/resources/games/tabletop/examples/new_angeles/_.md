# Introduction
New Angeles is a [tabletop game](/games/tabletop) in which players assume the role of a corporation
in a cyberpunk world and attempt to maximize their capital. It has a [multi-winner](/games/winning)
victory type.

# Victory
In New Angeles, each player is dealt a card indicating a rival player. They win if at the end of the
game they have accumulated greater points than their rival. Among the rival cards is one card called
the "Federalist". The Federalist has a special win condition, which, if invoked, causes the game to
end and all other players to immediately lose. Therefore, players have some cooperative incentive as
well as their competitive incentive.

> One flaw I have observed here is that players are often willing to out the Federalist by
> disclosing the identity of their rivals.
