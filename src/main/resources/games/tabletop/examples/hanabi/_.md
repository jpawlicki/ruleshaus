# Introduction
Hanabi is a [cooperative](/games/winning) [tabletop game](/games/tabletop) in which players attempt
to play cards collectively from their hands in a certain order. The game relies on
[hidden information](/games/information) to present the challenge: contents of a player's hand are
hidden from them, but visible to the other players. Communication between the players is restricted
to two specific phrase-types, which provide hints about the colors or ranks of cards in their hands.
Communication is also penalized by means of a token economy. The core dynamic of the game is
therefore achieving high communication efficiency.
