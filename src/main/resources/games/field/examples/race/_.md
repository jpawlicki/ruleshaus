# Introduction
A race is a common field game involving players starting at a specific point and trying to move to a
specific point faster than any of the other players.

Races come in many forms, for example foot races or car races, and can focus on speed (such as a
sprinting event) or endurance (such as a multi-day race).

Races also occur in abstract forms, in which case players are attempting to reach particular game
states before other players reach certain other game states. This form of race often appears in all
sorts of games, especially [single-winner](/games/winning) games with mutually exclusive goal
states.
