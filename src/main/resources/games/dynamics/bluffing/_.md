# Introduction
A bluffing dynamic occurs in multiplayer games when:
 * a player takes an action that is strong in some game states and weak (or different) in others,
 * that player knows whether the action is strong or weak,
 * other player(s) don't know whether the action was strong or weak,
 * and the optimal response of other player(s) depends on the strength of the action.

Bluffing requires [hidden information](/games/information).

# Form Considerations
Bluffing dynamics invariably involve the notion of *tells*, in which the players from whom the
information is hidden will attempt to determine by observation of the acting player's behavior (are
they nervous, do they blink, how long did it take them to decide to take that action, etc). Because
of this, bluffing dynamics are generally affected by the communication capabilities of the players
(bluffing in a tabletop session of [poker](/games/tabletop/examples/poker) is different from
bluffing in a digital version of the game).
