# Introduction
A prediction dynamic occurs whenever a player starts making predictions about what other players are
going to do, and adjusting their choices based on the prediction.

The prediction dynamic is present to some extent in almost all multiplayer games, but is strongly
present in games with [hidden information](/games/information), [simultaneous action
resolution](/games/tabletop), and under certain [bidding mechanics](/games/mechanics/bidding).

# Example
[Rock, Paper, Scissors](/games/tabletop/examples/rock_paper_scissors) is a game built entirely
around the prediction dynamic.
