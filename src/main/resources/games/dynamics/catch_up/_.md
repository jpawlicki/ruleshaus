# Introduction
Catch-up dynamics arise from mechanics that favor the trailing players over the leading players in a
game. They push the game toward converging player rank.

If catch-up dynamics are too strong, the early actions of players in a game don't matter. On the
other hand, if they are too weak or non-existent, only the early actions of players matter.

They are the opposite of [inertial dynamics](/games/dynamics/inertial).
