# Introduction
In the [MDA framework (PDF)](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf), dynamics are the
result of [Mechanics](/games/mechanics), and give rise to [Aesthetics](/games/aesthetics). Dynamics
can be summarized as "game behaviors" that arise from the mechanics.

# Examples
A character or unit in a game may perish when it reaches zero hit points. Enemies may do damage to
characters when battled. These mechanics combine to form a dynamic of attrition that discourages a
player from engaging too many foes without access to some form of recovery.
