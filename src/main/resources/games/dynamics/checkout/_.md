# Introduction
Checkout is a dynamic that occurs among players when the outcome of the game becomes certain (or
highly probable), but the game is not actually over.

As the remaining player actions do not contribute toward [winner selection](/games/winning), players
focused on winning are unlikely to remain invested in playing the game.

Checkout can occur among both leading and trailing players. If it occurs among all players at once,
forfeiture can generally be offered and accepted. 

Checkout is reduced by mechanics that push a game quickly toward winner announcement once
the [inertial dynamics](/games/dynamics/inertial) become insurmountable. Players seeking victory
have limited patience for "going through the motions", though players seeking a
[submission aesthetic](/games/aesthetics/submission) may benefit from checkout.

> A related concept is the ability for players to stall the end of game (but not achieve victory)
> indefinitely. Programmers are familiar with this concept from functional analysis, i.e. a boolean
> function either returns true, returns false, or runs forever.
