# Introduction
An anti-leader dynamic emerges when players focus efforts on harming the leading player. Anti-leader
dynamics are common in most [single-winner](/games/winning) games.

Anti-leader dynamics in games with more than two players can be considered a form of
[catch-up dynamic](/games/dynamics/catch_up). They contribute to a strongly competitive aesthetic,
but usually damage a [fellowship aesthetic](/games/aesthetics/fellowship).  In extreme cases,
anti-leader dynamics may be strong enough that it is better for players to avoid establishing a
clear lead. They can also contribute to [king-maker](/games/dynamics/king_maker) dynamics.
