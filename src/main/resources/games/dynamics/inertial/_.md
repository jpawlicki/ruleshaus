# Introduction
Inertial dynamics arise from mechanics that favor the leading players over the trailing players in a
game. They push the game toward diverging player ranks. Inertial dynamics are sometimes called "rich
get richer" dynamics.

They are the opposite of [catch-up dynamics](/games/dynamics/catch_up).
