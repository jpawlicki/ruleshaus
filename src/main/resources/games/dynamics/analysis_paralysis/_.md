# Introduction
Analysis paralysis occurs whenever a player of a game takes a long time to decide their next move
due to lengthy evaluation of all their options.

Analysis paralysis usually occurs when players attempt to find optimal play.

In some games, such as [chess](/games/tabletop/examples/chess), analysis paralysis is often
gameified by use of a real-time element such as an overall time limit on player turns.

Analysis paralysis is not always a voluntary behavior for a player.
