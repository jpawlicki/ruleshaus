Dungeons & Dragons (5th edition Player's Handbook)

The D&D5e PHB describes the action resolution mechanic of the game as follows:

> Does an adventurer's sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard
> scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across
> a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he
> or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action
> is uncertain, the Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a
> d20, to determine success or failure.
> 
> Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six *ability
> scores*. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,
> Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most
> adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These
> ability scores, and the *ability modifiers* derived from them, are the basis for
> almost every d20 roll that a players makes on a character's or monster's behalf.
> 
> Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20
> rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple
> steps.
> 
> *1. Roll the die and add a modifier.* Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier.
> This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and
> it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character's particular
> skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an
> ability's modifier.)
> 
> *2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.* A class feature, a spell, a 
> particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to
> the check.
> 
> *3. Compare the total to a target number.* If the total equals or exceeds the
> target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success.
> Otherwise, it's a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target
> numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving
> throws succeed or fail.
> 
> The target number of an ability check or a saving throw is called a *Difficulty
> Class* (DC). The target number of an attack roll is called an *Armor Class*
> (AC). This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. Chapter
> 7, "Using Ability Scores", provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the
> game.
> 
> ==Advantage and Disadvantage==
> Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special
> situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive
> circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite.
> When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you
> make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use
> the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage
> and roll a 17 and 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll these
> numbers, you use the 17.
> 
> More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.

===Common Cases===
Whether the character accomplishes their intent is determined by d20 +
modifiers >= target number.

A player aiding another player may provide them advantage on their check.
Another mechanic, gates whether the aid is useful. Larger group efforts
require each member of the group to make a roll. If half or more succeed, the
group succeeds.

Opposed efforts require each participant to roll, with the higher result
winning. A tie is interpreted as status quo.

Difficulty is represented by difficulty/armor class.

===Hooks===
1. Whether a roll has advantage, disadvantage, or neither.
2. Whether the proficiency bonus applies.
3. Magnitude of the proficiency bonus. (Character level.)
4. Whether the proficiency bonus is halved or doubled.

===Constants===
In normal play:
Proficiency bonuses scale from +2 to +6.
Ability score modifiers scale from -4 to +5.
Difficulties range from 5 (very easy) to 30 (nearly impossible), with a mode of 15 (medium).

===Notes===
There's also a notion of "Passive Checks", which is about evaluating non-actions
such as noticing a hidden monster. In this case, the same modifiers are reused,
but a roll of 10 is assumed, with +5 for advantage and -5 for disadvantage. This
becomes important for some opposed efforts.
