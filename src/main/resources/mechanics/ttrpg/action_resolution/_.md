The action resolution mechanics in a TTRPG are mechanics that assist the GM
in determining (or entirely determine themselves) whether the particular action
of a player realizes its intended effect. It may further indicate consequences
of an action, though it need not.

Most action resolution mechanics handle these common cases:
1. (Resolution) To accomplish X, a character does Y. Is X accomplished?
2. (Group Efforts) As above, but other characters aid them.
3. (Opposed Efforts) As above, but another character is simultaneously trying
	 to accomplish Z by doing W. Z and X are mutually exclusive. Which is
	 accomplished, if either?
4. (Difficulty) Certain effects are difficult to accomplish with a particular
   action. Others are easy. How is this represented?

Frequently, action resolution mechanics form the core of the TTRPG's mechanical
layer. They therefore often have *hooks* that other mechanics can influence.

Action resolution mechanics are considered separately from action legality
mechanics. Mechanics that allow or forbid certain actions are separate, and this
category is narrowly defined to determine whether or not a *legal* action
accomplishes its intent.
