# Introduction
Table-top role-playing games (TTRPGs) are a branch of [board game](/mechanics/bg) that include a
diverse collection of games in which players assume the role of a character in an imaginary world and
answer questions about what that character would do in certain situations.

TTRPGs frequently (but not always) are multiplayer.

TTRPGs frequently (but not always) designate a specific player as the /Game Master/. This player is
responsible for prompting the other players with situations in which to decide on actions.
