# Introduction
This section contains mechanics that are only practical to construct in games with computer aid.
Usually such mechanics require complex, frequent, or redundant mathematics. Mechanics requiring
sophisticated telecommunications also belong here.

Game mechanics that are equally applicable to computer and board games are categorized under
[board games](/mechanics/bg).

As with [board games](/mechanics/bg) and [table-top role-playing games](/mechanics/ttrpg), subpages
here are classified by function.
