# Introduction
Tabletop games are games (structured forms of play) generally characterized by mechanics simple enough
to be manually evaluated by human action or by the direct application of the laws of physics.

Tabletop games frequently (but not always) include physical pieces that can be set up in relation to each
other in order to assist tracking the state of the game.

In this library, board games are contrasted with [video games](/mechanics/vg) (in which the intent of
the designer is that a human will not evaluate the essential mechanics), and
[tabletop role-playing games](/mechanics/ttrpg), which are a type of board game, but due to the
specificity of that genre and the contributors' general interest are considered distinctly. Mechanics
that are suitable to both board games and video games or TTRPGs are organized as sub-pages here.

Additionally, there are *physical games* that meet the above definition, such as the game of tag,
which are considered out of scope of this section.

More properly, this section is *tabletop games*.
