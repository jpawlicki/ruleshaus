# Site Philosophy
> 十人十色 ("Ten People, Ten Colors")

Games are an area of extreme diversity, and any classification scheme runs the risk of failing to
encompass all aspects of them. Additionally, different people have different perspectives based on
their own tendancy to split or group, personal organizational habits, and experiences in their life.
Therefore, the content here is not meant to be taking as an authoritative or prescriptive
classification or recommendation, but is rather offered in the spirit of sharing. The advice here is
meant to be read as "what worked for me was...", offered with the full understanding that it may not
apply to every game or game session.
